summary: My dentist's website was very outdated and not really mobile friendly. I worked with him for a few months to determine what his website needed to convey, improve the color identity, and completely revamp it.

## Context

[My dentist's website][1] was not only outdated but also not adapted to mobile navigation, too flashy and not professional looking. In addition, he was not able to keep it up to date with his limited knowledge of web programming. In short, it needed to be entirely redone to represent better his work ethics and professionalism.

## Processus

I started by determining with him the important information that needed to be conveyed and what his brand would look like, from color identity to logo and overall feel of the website. I also assessed the maintainability requirement by asking what he knew and quickly evaluating how tech-savvy his team was.
After evaluating the requirements, I determined that React was a good solution to go with, as it allowed a fairly simple updating process, without having to deep to deep inside the markup, while providing a fairly fast initial setup for me.
Next step was to develop a visual view of the site, to have something to refer to throughtout the website development.
Finally, I developped the actual site and deployed it after proper testing on several browsers. 

## What I learned

This project was for me a great first step into a new technology (React) and gave me the necessary knowledge to be able to develop websites with React as a main front-end framework. This was also my first project for the real world, without the safety net of having an organisation like the university to back me up.
